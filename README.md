# Elite Dangerous Keypad for CustomKeypad iOS App
This repo includes a custom Elite Dangerous keypad for CustomKeypad iOS app as well as the vectors that were used to make the layout, for users of other apps or Android users that may have similar apps at their disposal.



CustomKeypad for iOS allows for invisible buttons. So this is essentially a background with invisible buttons over the top.

## Vector Graphics

Vector graphics have been provided (`.AI` , `.EPS` & `.SVG`) and can be used or modified to suit your needs. The licenses for the font and the Galaxy/System map images restrict the usage of this and derivative works to personal use, where attribution must be provided.



There are similar Air Keyboard/Keypad apps on iOS and Android. If you use an app that allows buttons to be invisible, whilst allowing interaction, the process for creating this layout is to:

1. place the buttons over the background image 
2. assign a keypress to the button
3. set the width and height *(See table below)*
4. hide the button
